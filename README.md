#  FizzBuzz

## About

This project is a UiPath C# implementation of FizzBuzz in UiPath.

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both three and five with the word "fizzbuzz" -Wikipedia

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.

### Details

**Practice:** [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)

**Project Format:** Windows, C#

**GitHub:** https://github.com/ShonHarsh/FizzBuzz

### Sample Output

```sh
05/13/2024 19:22:11 => [Info] FizzBuzz execution started
05/13/2024 19:22:11 => [Info] FizzBuzz.Main.Begin;
05/13/2024 19:22:14 => [Info] 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz
05/13/2024 19:22:14 => [Info] FizzBuzz.Main.End;
05/13/2024 19:22:14 => [Info] FizzBuzz execution ended in: 00:00:03
```

### Architecture Requirements

A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.
